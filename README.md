DCS(Data Collection System)

Welcome to the DCS wiki! This is a side project. I'm trying to build a mini system for collecting image data.

Just try it and tell me what function you want to implement.

<p>BOM List: 
<p>Rpi Zero W V1.1 
<p>Camera *1 (I used the OV5647)
<p>SD card 32G *1 (it will be nice to use 64GB) 
<p>FPC *1 
<p>220K ohm *1 
<p>LED *1 
<p>switch *1 
<p>screw *n 
<p>case (see the STL file) 
<p>micro USB cable *1 
<p>Mobile charge *1

How it's work? When Rpi power on, it will autorun main.py, Press the switch you can see the led turn on and camera capture image until you press the switch.

the image data will save at ~/Desktop/DP
